# SlappGraphs

SlappGraphs is a graph-based application framework built for developing relational data models with structured domain-based nodes and relationships. This system leverages an Active Graph Network (AGN) architecture to create and manage graph data structures within defined domains and subdomains. SlappGraphs enables the loading, querying, and visualization of nodes and relationships through a Flask-based REST API.

## Features

- **Domain-based Node Management**: Organize nodes within specific domains and subdomains for clearer data separation.
- **Active Graph Networks (AGN)**: Utilizes AGNNode structures to maintain nodes and relationships in a queryable graph.
- **Access Control Lists (ACL)**: Supports role-based access control, allowing control over who can access different nodes or relationships.
- **Relationship Management**: Define complex, multi-level relationships between nodes.
- **REST API**: Exposes endpoints to load, list, query, and manage nodes and relationships within the graph.

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `pip` for dependency management
- Flask for API services

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SlappGraphs.git
   cd SlappGraphs
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up configuration:**
   Ensure any environment-specific settings are configured in `.env` if necessary.

### Running the Application

1. **Run Flask:**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

2. **Access the API:**
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint           | Method | Description                             |
|--------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| `/load_graph`      | POST   | Load the graph from a JSON file         |
| `/list_nodes`      | GET    | List all nodes or nodes in a domain     |
| `/list_relationships` | GET | List all relationships                  |
| `/create_node`     | POST   | Create a new node                       |
| `/query_node`      | GET    | Retrieve details of a specific node     |

### Example API Usage

1. **Load the Graph Structure:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/load_graph
   ```

2. **List All Nodes:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/list_nodes
   ```

3. **Create a Node:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/create_node -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
     "node_id": "patient_123",
     "data": {"name": "John Doe", "age": 45, "medical_conditions": ["hypertension"]},
     "domain": "Healthcare",
     "type": "Patient"
   }'
   ```

4. **Query a Node:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/query_node?node_id=patient_123"
   ```

### Configuration

Modify `config.py` for application settings. You may include additional settings for database connections, environment settings, and more.

### Testing

Use the provided scripts in the `scripts/` directory to test individual features. For example:

```bash
python scripts/1_test_node_creation.py
```

### Future Enhancements

- **Visualization**: Build an interactive front-end to visualize nodes and relationships in real time.
- **External Database Integration**: Connect to external graph databases for larger datasets.
- **Advanced ACL and RBAC**: Extend ACL functionality for fine-grained control over node access.
