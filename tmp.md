Hereâ€™s a set of Mermaid diagrams that illustrate both hierarchical and cross-domain relationships for Active Graphs. Each diagram provides a unique perspective on how data can be structured to manage complex, inter-domain connections dynamically.

### Hierarchical Structure Diagram

This first diagram demonstrates a hierarchical structure, such as an organizational hierarchy. Here, **nodes** represent departments and individuals, and relationships like **reports to** or **manages** capture hierarchy.

```mermaid
graph TD

  subgraph Organization[Organization]
    CEO[CEO]
    CTO[CTO]
    HR[HR Manager]
    DevTeam[Development Team]
    Dev1[Developer A]
    Dev2[Developer B]
  end

  CEO --> CTO
  CEO --> HR
  CTO --> DevTeam
  DevTeam -- reports to --> CTO
  DevTeam --> Dev1
  DevTeam --> Dev2
```

### Cross-Domain Structure Diagram

This diagram shows a **multi-domain structure**, such as a healthcare system where *Patient* and *Doctor* nodes in the **Healthcare Domain** are linked to *Policy* in the **Financial Domain**. This showcases how relationships cross domains and enable inferencing across them.

```mermaid
graph TD

  subgraph HealthcareDomain[Healthcare Domain]
    Patient[Patient]
    Doctor[Doctor]
    MedicalRecord[Medical Record]
    Diagnosis[Diagnosis]
    Appointment[Appointment]
  end

  subgraph FinancialDomain[Financial Domain]
    Policy[Insurance Policy]
  end

  Patient -- has --> MedicalRecord
  Doctor -- performs --> Diagnosis
  Patient -- attends --> Appointment
  MedicalRecord -- relates to --> Diagnosis
  Diagnosis -- covered by --> Policy
```

In this structure:
- **Hierarchical connections**: Within each domain (e.g., *Healthcare Domain*), nodes are connected by relationships relevant to their context.
- **Cross-domain links**: Relationships like **covered by** connect nodes from different domains, bridging *Diagnosis* in the *Healthcare Domain* to *Policy* in the *Financial Domain*.

These diagrams emphasize how Active Graphs seamlessly handle both hierarchical and cross-domain relationships, enabling rich data interaction and inference capabilities across complex datasets. Let me know if you need further adjustments or additional connections!
