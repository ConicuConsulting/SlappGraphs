It looks like the `/create_node` endpoint is working perfectly now! The response confirms that the node was successfully created and returned in JSON format with the correct data structure:

```json
{
  "node": {
    "data": {
      "age": 45, 
      "medical_conditions": [
        "hypertension", 
        "diabetes"
      ], 
      "name": "John Doe"
    }, 
    "domain": "healthcare", 
    "node_id": "patient_123"
  }, 
  "status": "Node created"
}
```

### Next Steps
With the `create_node` endpoint functioning as expected, here are a few suggested next steps:

1. **Test the `/query` Endpoint**: Use a similar approach with `curl` to test the `/query` endpoint by retrieving nodes based on `node_id` to ensure data retrieval works.

2. **Expand API Functionality**: We can now add more endpoints or functionality, such as updating or deleting nodes, querying nodes by domain, and linking nodes across domains.

3. **Logging and Error Handling**: Enhance the API with improved logging and error handling for production readiness, ensuring any issues are captured in logs and communicated clearly in responses.

4. **Documentation**: Consider adding API documentation for each endpoint, detailing the required parameters, expected responses, and example requests, which could also help in generating automated API testing scripts.
