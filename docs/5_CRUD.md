It looks like the `load_graph` function is now working perfectly, as all nodes and relationships defined in `healthcare.json` have been successfully loaded and are correctly listed with their respective relationships, domains, and node types.

### Next Steps:
1. **API Expansion**: We can add or modify API endpoints to interact with these nodes, including:
   - **CRUD operations** for nodes (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   - **Querying** nodes based on specific criteria, like domain or relationships.
   - **Advanced relationship exploration**, such as retrieving paths or hierarchies in the graph.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Consider visualizing the graph using a frontend tool or library (e.g., D3.js) for better user interaction with the data structure.
   - This can be integrated within the Flask app as a new endpoint or dashboard for easier exploration of relationships and entities.

3. **Refinement and Testing**:
   - Additional testing and error handling can further enhance reliability, especially when dealing with missing nodes or malformed JSON in future graphs.
   - We can add domain-specific filters or other advanced query options as needed.

Would you like to proceed with implementing any specific API, visualization, or further testing?
