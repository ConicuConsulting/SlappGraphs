Great to hear that it’s running smoothly! Here are some next steps to enhance the project:

### 1. **API Testing**
   - **Verify Functionality**: Test the `/create_node` and `/query` endpoints to ensure that nodes are correctly created and queried.
   - **Use Postman or CURL**: Send `POST` requests to `/create_node` with example JSON data and `GET` requests to `/query` to test retrieval.

### 2. **Extend Services for AGN Operations**
   - **Expand AGNService**: Add methods to support more advanced AGN functionality, like:
     - **Update Node**: Allow nodes to be updated with new data or relationships.
     - **Delete Node**: Provide an option to delete nodes.
     - **Relationship Queries**: Enable deeper queries across relationships in multiple domains.

### 3. **Enhance API with Contextual Queries**
   - **Cross-Domain Queries**: Integrate queries that can cross-reference domains, useful for complex relationships.
   - **Query Syntax**: Allow API users to filter nodes by domain, relationship type, and custom attributes.

### 4. **Build a Frontend for Visualizing AGNs**
   - **Interactive Graphs**: Use a JavaScript library (like D3.js or Cytoscape) to visualize nodes and relationships dynamically.
   - **Node Details**: Display contextual information when nodes are clicked, allowing users to navigate through relationships.

### 5. **Documentation and Testing**
   - **Documentation**: Document the API endpoints, AGN structure, and querying syntax in `README.md` or an expanded `/docs` section.
   - **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for each service and API endpoint to ensure stability.

### 6. **Future Enhancements**
   - **API Gateway for Queries**: Implement an API gateway for managing access, especially if this will be used across multiple applications.
   - **ACL Integration**: Add Access Control Lists to manage who can view or manipulate specific nodes or domains.
   - **Graph Expansion Rules**: Allow rule-based node and relationship creation to infer additional data or automate AGN updates.

These steps will solidify the base functionality and pave the way for scaling up and deploying the AGN framework into real-world applications. Let me know if you’d like to focus on any specific step, and I can assist with implementation!
